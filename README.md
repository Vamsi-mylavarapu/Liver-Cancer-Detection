# Liver-Cancer-Detection
Abstract: Histopathological image analysis (HIA) is a crucial step in cancer detection and done manually by the pathologists. As mentioned earlier we have to minimize time consumption and here we proposed an automatic HIA based on deep learning to improve the accuracy and efficiency of diagnosis. The model takes the “Whole Slide Image (WSI)” as an input and image preprocessing is done using OpenCV libraries. The patch level features of the WSI are extracted by “Transfer Learning” using ResNet50 and then combined with the “Multiple Instance Learning” to acquire the final image level features for classification. The proposed method can distinguish and classify liver histopathological images as abnormal or normal with high accuracy, thus providing support for the early diagnosis of liver cancer.

Steps Involved:

WSI Preprocessing
Feature Extraction
Feature Selection
